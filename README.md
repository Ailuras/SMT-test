# SMT-test

This project provides a framework for running SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers in batch and parallel, and generating charts based on the results for analyzing and comparing the performance of different solvers or strategies.

## Branch Description

This project contains multiple branches, each focusing on specific tests or features:

*   **main**: The main branch, containing the stable version and core functionalities of the project.
*   **Incremental-test-2025**: Focuses on incremental solving tests (intended for related work in 2025).
*   **OMT-test-2024**: Focuses on OMT (Optimization Modulo Theories) solver tests (for related work in 2024).
*   **String-SMT-2024**: Focuses on SMT problems involving string theories (for related work in 2024).
